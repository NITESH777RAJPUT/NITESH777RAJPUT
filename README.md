I am Nitesh Singh, a Computer Engineering student currently in my second year at the International School of Business & Media (ISBM), originally from Uttar Pradesh, India. I have strong skills in web development and enjoy building modern, responsive, and user-friendly applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. I have hands-on experience in creating landing pages, portfolio websites, resume builder applications, and complete UI layouts that work smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices. I also have basic full-stack knowledge, having worked with Node.js and Python (Flask) for backend development, along with handling authentication and data persistence using localStorage. I have built several real-world projects such as a resume builder web app (7Builder), an Intelligent Personal Finance Management System for HackSprint Hackathon 2025, and a TO-DO application during my web development internship. I am familiar with Git, GitHub, and deploying projects on platforms like Vercel, and I have also completed my first paid freelancing project by building a landing page for a client. Along with technical skills, I have a strong interest in problem-solving, basic knowledge of Java and assembly language, an understanding of core engineering subjects, and a growing interest in AI and certifications. I am highly motivated, consistent in learning, and actively working on improving my English communication skills while continuously enhancing my development and design abilities.
